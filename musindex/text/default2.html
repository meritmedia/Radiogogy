Art is an instrument for change in ways that speeches can never be. There is nothing
more powerful than an idea encapsulated in song, painting, sculpture, or dance.  The goal of MusIndex.com is to help connect 
the people who have devoted their lives to the pursuit of creating this art
with the people who appreciate the effort and the meanings behind their works.
